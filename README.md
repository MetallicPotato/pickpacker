A simple channel packing tool. 

## About
I've run across channel packing utilities before, but never found one that would let me choose the channels to use of my imported textures, allowing me to repack stuff that's already been packed! It'll be useful if you have to repack purchased asset textures for a custom material setup. I hope you find some use for it!

## What is channel packing?
Channel packing is the act of storing black and white image data (such as a roughness/smoothness map, a metallic map, or a mask) in the color channels of an image, allowing you to store up to four black and white maps in one texture! This can help reduce the number of textures you need to store in your game, and improve your game's performance!

## Formats
PickPacker currently supports PNG, JPG, Bitmap (BMP), Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), Targa (TGA), and WebP imported files.
It currently only exports to PNG.
